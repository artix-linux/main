This directory /usr/share/ca-certificates/trust-source/ contains CA certificates
and trust settings in the PEM file format. The trust settings found here will be
interpreted with a low priority - lower than the ones found in 
/etc/ca-certificates/trust-source/ .

=============================================================================
QUICK HELP: To add a certificate in the simple PEM or DER file formats to the
            list of CAs trusted on the system:

            Copy it to the
                    /usr/share/ca-certificates/trust-source/anchors/
            subdirectory, and run the
                    update-ca-trust
            command.

            If your certificate is in the extended BEGIN TRUSTED file format,
            then place it into the main trust-source/ directory instead.
